            <p class="dades">The name of the game is Drone-Aid.The objective of the game is to use a drone to deliver materials remote island in the Asian Pacific that was just affected by an earthquake. Delivering the materials will be tricky, there are tall cell towers near the drop off loctions with the highest populations. You will need to avaid the cell towers or the drones will crash into them or be damaged.

                The mission is to deliver as many materials to the island while avoiding the cell towers.  Your goal is to aid at least 1300 people. If you hit a cell tower it will negatively impact your score and the amount of people you have aided because they will have to use the materials to fix the cell towers instead of supplying and repairing the island.
                This game was developed using HTML, CSS and Javascript.
